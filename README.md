# SWE432 Hands On Sessions
** last updated: Fall 2021
During the semester this repo will be updated on Thursdays before the TA office hours, the goal is to further explore concepts learned in the lectures and work closely with their related code.

## Session 1: Vanilla JS vs. French Vanilla JS (1990s vs. 2020s)
JavaScript (JS) is the standard language for web browsers and becoming popular among web servers. It has come a long way, in  a nutshell:

### JS is Loosely typed (like Python, Perl, PHPâ€¦)
No need for ```String x= "";```, yet you can be explicit when manipulating data types: 
- String casting:
```js
let x = '1', y =1; let z= x+y; // string concat 
```
- Integer casting:
```js
let x = '1', y =1; let z= +x+y; // int sum
```
